								    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
								      <p>Your investments in the fractional ownership of properties are subjected to the fluctuations in price movement of the real estate market driven by greater economic conditions.

								    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
								      <p>The property price reflects the value of the real property asset. The trust NAV is the summation of the property price, the cost amortisation and the cash reserve.
								      </p>
								      <p>

								    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
								      <p>The total amount of the stamp duties and setup cost will turn into an intangible asset of the trust and straight line depreciation over the 15 years trust life at roughly 2% per year (of the initial property value).
								      </p>
								      <p>At any point in time, the monthly trust valuation will reflect the current amortisation schedule. As the trust units are transferable, a buyer of units in a subsequent transaction will pay for the property value with this amortisation added into the price, to compensate the seller of units the remaining amount of the un-amortised cost. (i.e. For a transaction at Year 3, 12 years' worth of un-amortised cost will be added to the agreed price paid by the Buyer to the Seller, approximately 24% of the initial property value).</p>

								    <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How do I earn the rental income from my fractionally owned property?</a>
								    <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
								      <p>Rental income will be credited to the trust cash reserve to be set off against any property related expenses (i.e. property taxes, strata fee, maintenance, insurance) and the platform fee. The excess amount in the cash reserve balance over the targeted 2-4% threshold shall be paid to your designated account on a quarterly basis via compulsory redemption of units.
